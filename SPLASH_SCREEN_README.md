    builder: (context) => SplashScreen(),
  ),
);
```

### With Lottie Animation
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => SplashScreen(
      useLottieAnimation: true,
    ),
  ),
);
```

### Demo Screen
To test both versions, you can use the demo screen:
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => SplashDemoScreen(),
  ),
);
```

## 🎯 Animation Details

### Logo Animations
- **Scale Animation**: Elastic bounce effect from 0 to 100%

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors
The splash screen uses your existing color scheme:

### Custom Painters
- `ParticlePainter`: Renders floating particles with consistent positioning
- `SparklePainter`: Creates twinkling star effects

### Performance Optimizations
- Fixed random seeds for consistent particle positions
- Efficient custom painters with minimal repaints
- Proper animation controller disposal
- Optimized gradient rendering

## 🎉 Result
